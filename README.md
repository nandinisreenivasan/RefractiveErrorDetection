# RefractiveErrorDetection

1) Refractive Error detection using Machine Learning Algorithm is a research based project to predict the accurate refractive error in an human eye. 

2) We have compared different ML algorithm and used an effective algorithm for the model and obtained an accuracy of 83.3%.

3) With 11 features selection we were able to identify the refractive error through a online mode(website).
